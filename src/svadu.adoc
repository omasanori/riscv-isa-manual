== "Svadu" Extension for Hardware Updating of A/D Bits, Version 1.0

The Svadu extension adds support and CSR controls for hardware updating of PTE A/D bits.

If the Svadu extension is implemented, the `menvcfg`.ADUE field is writable.
If the hypervisor extension is additionally implemented, the `henvcfg`.ADUE
field is also writable.
See xref:machine.adoc#sec:menvcfg[Machine Environment Configuration Register] and xref:hypervisor.adoc#sec:henvcfg[Hypervisor Environment Configuration Register] for the definitions of those fields.

xref:supervisor.adoc#sec:translation[Addressing and Memory Protection] defines the semantics of hardware updating of A/D bits.  When
hardware updating of A/D bits is disabled, the Svade extension, which mandates
exceptions when A/D bits need be set, instead takes effect.
The Svade extension is also defined in xref:supervisor.adoc#sec:translation[Addressing and Memory Protection].
